        <div class="FAQ">
            <div class="question"> How do I add a new dress? </div>
            <div class="answer">To add a new dress, click the '+' button on in the top right corner of the screen and select "Add Dress" from the dialog. From there, you can type in the designer and style number of your dress. If can't fill out the prom or dress image yet, don't worry! You can always edit your dress by selecting it from your profile page!
            </div>
            <div class="question"> What if I don't have facebook? </div>
            <div class="answer"> We have received some feedback that users would like to login with email rather than connect with facebook. Based on this feedback we have have decided to add email login to the website. In the coming weeks we will add the email login feature to our iOS application. If you would like to login with email, you may do so through the website starting today, and in the future you will be able to through the webapp as well.
            </div>
            <div class="question"> What is a style number? </div>
            <div class="answer"> Style numbers are unique combinations of letters and words that designers assign to dresses to distinguish them. They can usually be found on the tag of a dress, or somewhere on a webpage if you are buying online. If you cannot find a style number while shopping, ask a store representative for help; they will know where to find it. The style number field is required because it is the only way to distinguish two dresses without confusion, a description of its color or how it looks may vary from person to person, so is not as reliable.

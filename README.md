Worried about someone showing up to prom wearing a dress just like yours? Register your dress with Prom App and worry no more!

You can search for stores near you to start shopping, then keep track of dresses you like in your profile. You can find your school's prom too! If your school's prom isn't on Prom App yet, you can create one yourself! When you have picked a dress you are going to buy, you can register that dress for a prom. Once a dress has been registered, Prom App will make sure no one else registers the same dress for the same prom.

Store owners can manage their stores through our web portal. For now, Android users must also use the web portal.

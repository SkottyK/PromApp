PromApp
=======

A simple prom dress registration tool for stores and students.

No one wants to show up to the prom wearing the same dress as someone else. Stores try to coordinate, but there is no established system to compare what people will wear. Also, when girls borrow dresses or buy them online, they can cause conflicts despite the efforts of stores. This app allows stores and girls to register dresses for prom so that they don't conflict with one another.

In the future there will be a web client for stores to use.
